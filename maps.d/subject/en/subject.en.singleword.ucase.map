# This file only contains UPPERCASE words, one per entry.
#
# This can be dangerous and should only be used if:
# - The subject only consists of one word and should be additionally equipped
#   with line boundaries.
# - The subject consists of several words, but can be reliably declared as spam
#   with just one word.
#
# If an entry is commented out then we have received false/positive mails.
# This way we know that the entry is not usable.
